## **SLAM and autonomous navigation with ROS + kinect + Arduino**

This is the project for the autonomous navigation of the mobile robot which is built from scratch by myself with a huge support from Dr.Stephen Alty at Royal Holloway, University of London

## History

1. [I have tried Cam Jam Edukit 3 Robotics](https://github.com/CamJam-EduKit/EduKit3)

   <img src="images/bought_pi.jpg" width=60%>

<img src="images/bought_camjam.jpg" width=60%>

2. Try making it powerful by attaching metal plates

   <img src="images/robot_v1_1.jpg" width=60%>

<img src="images/robot_v1_2.jpg" width=60%>

hmm... does not look pretty good and it was quite unstable... Eventually it got broken.lol

3. So I have decided to refurbish the base by using wooden pranks

   <img src="images/robot_v2_1.jpg" width=60%>

<img src="images/robot_v2_2.jpg" width=60%>

<img src="images/robot_v2_3.jpg" width=60%>

<img src="images/robot_v2_4.jpg" width=60%>

this time it turned out that the legs was not stable... I mean it's obviously looks like a legless bouncing chicken.

4. So I bought two DC motors and a caster wheel for a chair! and replaced the chicken legs with them!

5. Finally I moved on to playing with Kinect and solder a bit of the power supply cable of it to attach the DC DC converter which is connected to the portable power supply!
